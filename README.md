# Copilot Extension Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Copilot Extension! This powerful tool is designed to enhance the coding experience by providing intelligent code suggestions, debugging assistance, refactoring tips, and much more.

## Key Features

1. **Code Suggestions**
   - Copilot offers intelligent code suggestions to help you write code faster and more efficiently. By analyzing the context of the code you are writing, Copilot can provide relevant completions that match your current coding task.
   - To use this feature, simply place your cursor anywhere in the editor where you need a suggestion or completion and press the keybinding `Ctrl + Shift + S`. Copilot will then generate suggestion based on the current code context, which will be added in your editor at your cursor.
   - You will have the option to accept or reject each suggestion. If you find a suggestion helpful, you can accept it to automatically insert it into your code. Conversely, if the suggestion does not meet your needs, you can reject it and continue coding.
   - This feature is particularly useful for repetitive coding tasks, boilerplate code, and when you need to quickly implement common patterns or functions, saving you time and reducing the likelihood of syntax errors.

2. **Debugging Assistance**
   - Identify and fix issues in your code with ease. Use the `/debug` command followed by your code to get detailed insights and suggestions for resolving errors.
   - This feature helps you understand what might be going wrong in your code and offers potential fixes, making debugging a smoother process.
   -  Copilot will return your code with the necessary debugging changes, which you can move to your editor at the cursor point using the move button.

3. **Code Refactoring**
   - Improve the structure and readability of your code with the `/refactor` command followed by your code.
   - Copilot provides recommendations for refactoring your code to follow best practices. This feature ensures that your code is clean, efficient, and maintainable.

4. **Code Commenting**
   - Add meaningful comments to your code using the `/comment` command followed by your code. Copilot will generate comments that explain the purpose and functionality of your code.
   - This feature is particularly useful for documenting your code and making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand later.
   - Copilot will return your code with the added comments, which you can seamlessly insert into your editor at the cursor point using the move button.
